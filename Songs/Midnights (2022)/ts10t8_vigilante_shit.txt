Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie
They say looks can kill, and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately I've been dressing for revenge
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately I've been dressing for revenge
She needed cold hard proof, so I gave her some
She had thе envelope, whеre you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Driving in your Benz
Lately she's been dressing for revenge
She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately she's been dressing for revenge
Ladies always rise above, ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The ladies are simply enough
Well he was doing lines, and crossing all of mine
Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocence
I'm on the vigilante shit again
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately I've been dressin' for revenge

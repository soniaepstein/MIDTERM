"It only hurts this much right now"
That's what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators, never trusted it
If it rises fast, it can't last
Uh-oh, I'm falling in love
Oh, no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down, how'd you turn it right around?
It only feels this rough right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
You know how much I hate that everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that
Uh-oh, I'm falling in love
Oh, no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down, how'd you turn it right around?
Uh-oh, I'm falling in love
Oh, no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down, how'd you turn it right around?
Uh-oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
Oh, no, I'm falling in love again (falling in love again)
Oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I thought the plane was going down, how'd you turn it right around?
Uh-oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
Oh, no, I'm falling in love again (falling in love again)
Oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I thought the plane was going down, how'd you turn it right around?

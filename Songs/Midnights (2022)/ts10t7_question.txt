I remember
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing goin' on
I swear that it was somethin'
'Cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since
But one thing after another
Lost in situations, circumstances, miscommunications
And I have to say, by the way
I just made life some explanations
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds latеr, they were clapping, too?
Thеn what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight? Oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind
With some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on something
It was one drink after another
Fucking politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the grey
I just may like to have a conversation
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clapping, too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight? Oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
Does it feel like everything's just like second best
After that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard
That you're still with her? That's nice
I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you (Was making fun of you)
But fifteen seconds later, they were clapping, too?
Then what did you do? (Do)
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight? Oh (More of a fight)
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
